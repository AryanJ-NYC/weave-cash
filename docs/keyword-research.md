---

## Executive Summary

The crypto payment gateway space has significant search demand with **"crypto payment gateway" at 1,400 US monthly searches** (5,600 global) as the top non-branded keyword. However, competition is fierce — most core product keywords have Keyword Difficulty (KD) scores of 75-90, dominated by incumbents like BitPay, NOWPayments, and CoinGate.

**Key findings:**

1. **Competitor brands dominate organic traffic.** BitPay (4,500 US/mo), CoinGate (2,800), Coinbase Commerce (2,100), and NOWPayments (1,300) own the parent topics for most high-volume keywords. Weave Cash must build brand awareness alongside topical authority.

2. **The biggest content opportunity is informational/how-to content.** Keywords like "how to accept crypto payments as a business" (300/mo, KD 35) and "how to accept crypto payments on website" (150/mo, KD 19) have achievable difficulty scores and clear commercial intent.

3. **"Web3 payments" is a low-competition gem.** At 200 US/mo with KD 15, this keyword aligns perfectly with Weave Cash's positioning and has almost no organic competition.

4. **Cross-chain and chain abstraction keywords are under-served.** "Chain abstraction" (150/mo, KD 17) and "cross chain swap" (200/mo, KD 22) are emerging terms with low difficulty — ideal for thought-leadership content.

5. **Use-case keywords (invoicing, payroll, recurring) have moderate volume but low competition** — strong candidates for feature-specific landing pages.

## Cluster 3: Competitor & Brand Keywords

Understanding competitor search demand and brand authority.

| Keyword | US Vol | Global Vol | KD | CPC | Traffic Pot. | Parent Topic | Intent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| bitpay | 4,500 | 15,000 | 48 | $4.00 | 12,000 | bitpay | Info, Branded |

**Takeaway:** BitPay is the market leader by search volume. NOWPayments and CoinGate appear as parent topics for many generic keywords, meaning they rank #1 for those terms. Weave Cash should create comparison pages ("Weave Cash vs BitPay," "Weave Cash vs NOWPayments") targeting these branded searches. Triple-A has negligible search demand.

**Takeaway:** "Chain abstraction" (KD 17) and "cross chain swap" (KD 22) are the standout opportunities here. These are technically relevant to how Weave Cash works and have low competition. "Dex aggregator" (KD 22) is also worth targeting with educational content about how Weave Cash's backend works.

## Cluster 5: Web3 & DeFi Payment Keywords

Emerging keywords in the Web3/DeFi payments space — Weave Cash's natural territory.

| Keyword | US Vol | Global Vol | KD | CPC | Traffic Pot. | Parent Topic | Intent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| web3 payments | 200 | 700 | 15 | $6.00 | 100 | web3 payments | Informational |

| web3 payment processing | 0 | 0 | — | — | — | — | — |
| defi invoicing | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

**Takeaway:** "Web3 payments" is a golden keyword — 200 US/mo, KD 15, $6.00 CPC (indicating commercial value), and no one owns this space yet. Weave Cash should aggressively target this term and aim to be the definitive result. Other terms in this cluster have low volume now but are growing — worth producing content early to establish authority.

## Cluster 6: Use-Case Keywords (Invoicing, Payroll, Freelancers, DAOs)

Keywords tied to specific use cases Weave Cash can serve.

| Keyword | US Vol | Global Vol | KD | CPC | Traffic Pot. | Parent Topic | Intent |

**Takeaway:** "Crypto payroll" stands out with KD 46, $11.00 CPC, and massive traffic potential (17,000) via the "rise" parent topic. "Crypto invoicing" and "recurring crypto payments" are perfect for feature pages. "DAO treasury management" (KD 0) is completely uncontested and directly relevant to Weave Cash's DAO audience.

---

## Cluster 7: Question-Based / Informational Keywords

Keywords phrased as questions — ideal for blog posts, guides, and FAQ pages.

| Keyword | US Vol | Global Vol | KD | CPC | Traffic Pot. | Parent Topic | Intent |

| is crypto payment safe | 0 | 10 | — | — | — | — | — |

**Takeaway:** The "how to accept crypto" cluster is the highest-priority content opportunity. KD scores of 19-38 are achievable for a new site, and these keywords have clear buyer intent (merchants looking to integrate). "Best crypto payment processor" (KD 83) is too competitive now but worth targeting long-term with a comprehensive comparison piece.

## Opportunity Analysis

### Quick Wins (Low KD, High Relevance)

These keywords can be ranked for relatively quickly and are directly relevant to Weave Cash:

| Keyword | US Vol | KD | Why It's a Win |
|---|---|---|---|
| web3 payments | 200 | 15 | Perfect product positioning, no incumbent owns it |
| chain abstraction | 150 | 17 | Core technology concept, emerging search term |
| how to accept crypto payments on website | 150 | 19 | High commercial intent, tutorial format |
| cross chain swap | 200 | 22 | Core technology, low competition |
| dex aggregator | 250 | 22 | Educational content about Weave Cash's backend |
| how to accept crypto as a business | 100 | 23 | Merchant-intent guide content |
| how to accept crypto payments as a business | 300 | 35 | Same cluster, higher volume |
| dao treasury management | 30 | 0 | Completely uncontested, niche but relevant |
| accept ethereum | 250 | 38 | Chain-specific landing page opportunity |
| crypto payment plugin | 150 | 41 | Product feature page for e-commerce integrations |
| recurring crypto payments | 200 | 42 | Feature-specific landing page |

### Content Gaps

Areas where search demand exists but content is thin or non-existent:

1. **"Accept stablecoin payments"** — Parent topic is "stripe crypto," meaning Stripe's content dominates. Weave Cash can own the pure crypto-to-crypto angle here.
2. **"Crypto invoicing"** — At KD 47, this is a feature page opportunity. Few dedicated tools focus on crypto invoicing.
3. **"Web3 payments"** — This entire topic is unclaimed. A definitive guide could rank quickly.
4. **"Chain abstraction" in payments context** — Most content is theoretical. Weave Cash can provide the practical application angle.
5. **"DAO payments" / "DAO treasury management"** — Extremely low competition, and DAOs are a target audience.

### Parent Topic Concentration

Several high-volume keywords share the same parent topic, meaning one well-optimized page can capture multiple keywords:

| Parent Topic | Keywords Feeding Into It | Combined US Volume |
|---|---|---|
| crypto payment processor | 8+ keyword variants | ~4,500+ |
| accept crypto payments | 6+ keyword variants | ~1,800+ |
| bitpay | 4+ keyword variants | ~1,500+ |
| nowpayments | 3+ keyword variants | ~2,500+ |
| coingate | 2+ keyword variants | ~350+ |

---

## Competitive Landscape

### Who Dominates Which Parent Topics

| Competitor | Parent Topics Owned | Estimated Brand Volume (US) |
|---|---|---|
| **BitPay** | "bitpay", "crypto payment" (generic), "how to pay with cryptocurrency" | 4,500/mo |
| **CoinGate** | "coingate", "crypto merchant services", "crypto payment gateway for website" | 2,800/mo |
| **Coinbase Commerce** | "coinbase commerce" | 2,100/mo |
| **NOWPayments** | "nowpayments", "crypto payments", "cryptocurrency payment gateway" | 1,300/mo |
| **Cryptomus** | "cryptomus" | 1,100/mo |
| **SimpleSwap** | "swap crypto", "crypto swap" | dominates swap-related terms |
| **BTCPay Server** | "btcpay" (open-source niche) | 200/mo |
| **Plisio** | "plisio" | 150/mo |

### Competitive Positioning for Weave Cash

Weave Cash's differentiator — crypto-to-crypto with invisible conversion — maps to keywords that incumbents don't own:
- **"web3 payments"** — No incumbent owns this
- **"chain abstraction"** — Emerging concept, no brand dominance
- **"cross chain swap" + "payments"** — No one combines these topics
- **"accept stablecoin payments"** — Stripe-adjacent but Weave Cash is a better fit for pure-crypto merchants
