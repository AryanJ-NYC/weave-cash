# Marketing Guidelines

Marketing copy and landing page guidelines for Weave Cash.

## Product Definition

**Weave Cash is a crypto-to-crypto payment platform.** Merchants set what crypto they want to receive; customers pay in whatever crypto they have. The conversion happens invisibly via NEAR intents.

**Important:** This is crypto-to-crypto only. No fiat currencies (USD, EUR, etc.).

## Value Proposition

**Core Promise:** Accept crypto payments in any token. Settle instantly in your preferred cryptocurrency.

### Persona-Problem-Solution Framework

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|

| **Problem** | Customers have different tokens; merchants want specific settlement currency |
| **Solution** | NEAR intents automatically swap incoming tokens to merchant's preferred crypto |
| **Benefits** | Multi-chain acceptance, instant settlement, self-custody |

## Primary Headline
